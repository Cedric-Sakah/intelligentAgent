# Pathfinding Simulation

This repository contains a basic Python implementation of a pathfinding simulation using pygame. 

**Features:**

* **Grid-based Environment:** The simulation takes place on a 20x15 grid.
* **Obstacles:** The grid includes obstacles represented by black squares.
* **Agent:** A simple agent is implemented that attempts to navigate the grid.
* **Target:** A target location is defined on the grid.
* **Visualization:** The simulation is visualized using pygame, displaying the grid, obstacles, agent, and target.

**To Run:**

1. **Install pygame:**
   ```bash
   pip install pygame
